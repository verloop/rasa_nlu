## FAQ
### What is this?
rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a tool for intent classification and entity extraction. You can think of rasa NLU as a set of high level APIs for building your own language parser using existing NLP and ML libraries.

### Who is it for?
The intended audience is mainly __people developing bots__, looking to find a a drop-in replacement for [wit](https://wit.ai), [LUIS](https://luis.ai), or [api.ai](https://api.ai). The setup process is designed to be as simple as possible. rasa NLU is written in Python, but you can use it from any language through a HTTP API. If your project is written in Python you can simply import the relevant classes. If you're currently using wit/LUIS/api.ai, you just:

1. Download your app data from wit, LUIS, or api.ai and feed it into rasa NLU
2. Run rasa NLU on your machine and switch the URL of your wit/LUIS api calls to `localhost:5000/parse`.

### Why should I use rasa NLU?
* You don't have to hand over your data to FB/MSFT/GOOG
* You don't have to make a `https` call to parse every message.
* You can tune models to work well on your particular use case.

These points are laid out in more detail in a [blog post](https://medium.com/lastmile-conversations/do-it-yourself-nlp-for-bot-developers-2e2da2817f3d). rasa is a set of tools for building more advanced bots, developed by [LASTMILE](https://golastmile.com). rasa NLU is the natural language understanding module, and the first component to be open sourced. 

### Why don't you have feature X?
Check the issues here on GitHub, there might be someone else talking about the same thing. 
If there isn't, please create a new issue, describe your use case, and the community can discuss how it could be implemented.

### What languages does it support?
Short answer: English, German, and Spanish currently. 
Longer answer: If you want to add a new language, the key things you need are a tokenizer and a set of word vectors. 
Once you've found those, feel free to create an issue.

## Use
### A. Install Locally
```
python setup.py install
python -m rasa_nlu.server -e wit &
curl 'http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello'
```

### B. Install with Docker
Before you start, ensure you have the latest version of docker engine on your machine. You can check if you have docker installed by typing ```docker -v``` in your terminal.

#### 1. Build the image:
```
docker build -t rasa_nlu .
``` 

#### 2. Start the web server:
```
docker run -p 5000:5000 rasa_nlu start
```

#### 3. Test it!
```
curl 'http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello'
```

### C. (Experimental) Deploying to Docker Cloud
